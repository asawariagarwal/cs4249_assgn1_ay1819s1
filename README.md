Independent Variable Introduced: Input Style: Touch vs Stylus

Dependent Variable Recorded: Reported Ease of Use (Using post experiement questionnaire)

Modifications made:
1. Implemented new independent variable : Input style
2. Added interface screen to display experiemnt instructions and to collect participant ID as input
3. Track particpant ID along with other data for each participant
4. Allow re-use of experiement for multiple participants
5. Update experiment conditions with the extra IV introduced

Instructions to run:
1. Load the main experiment.html file
2. The first screen has the title, experiment instructions and field to input Participant ID
3. Enter ID and click on begin experiment
4. This will bring you the experiement condition set up for the participant (involving 12 conditions)
5. Once all 12 conditions are done, clicking on Next/Done will record the data (including the partcipantID) and bring you back to the instructions screen for the experiment to begin for the next partcipant

Future Works:
1. Add more sets of conditions and create random generator to pick experiment set
2. Improve interface and include the pre ans post questionnaires in the website
